# Number Guessing Game

A simple console-based number guessing game in C, allowing players to choose between two modes: Default Mode and Custom Mode.

## Instructions

1. **Mode Selection:**
   - Enter `1` for Default Mode.
   - Enter `2` for Custom Mode.

2. **Input Validation:**
   - The program checks for valid integer input. If an invalid input is entered, the user is prompted to provide a valid integer.

3. **Custom Mode:**
   - In Custom Mode, the player is asked to set an upper limit for the randomly generated number.

4. **Guessing the Number:**
   - Players make guesses to determine the randomly generated number.
   - Feedback is provided based on whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.

5. **Game Statistics:**
   - After successfully guessing the number, the player is informed about the number of attempts.
   - The best score is tracked and displayed after deciding not to restart the game.

6. **Restart Option:**
   - After each game, players have the option to restart or exit the program.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - The program includes error handling for non-integer inputs, guiding users to enter valid input.

## Code Explanation

The code utilizes basic C programming constructs and features such as loops, conditionals, arrays, and random number generation.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the executable file in the console.

## Note

- The Default Mode is labeled as a work in progress.
- The game tracks the best score in terms of the fewest attempts in Custom Mode.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code as needed!
